Week 1.1 – Initial Setup & Tkinter Testing
Started testing early GUI prototypes today. The main window loaded fine, but the buttons didn’t trigger anything yet. Tried linking the play/pause functions to dummy print statements just to confirm event binding worked — it did.
Ran into a problem where the app froze whenever I clicked a button. Turned out I was calling the function instead of passing a reference (command=play() instead of command=play). Fixed it and re-ran, all good.

Also tested resizing — the window wasn’t scaling properly because I forgot to use .pack(fill="both", expand=True). Added that and layout looks cleaner.


Week 1.2 – Local Folder and Playback
Tested folder selection for loading songs. Used filedialog.askdirectory() and verified that .mp3 files in the folder appeared in the playlist.
At first, it crashed when selecting an empty folder — fixed that by adding a simple if files: check before populating the list.

Playback testing: used pygame.mixer for audio. Sometimes it wouldn’t stop the current track before playing the next one. Added a mixer.music.stop() before mixer.music.load() and re-tested. Works fine now.

Also noticed clicking “Next” twice too quickly caused a crash (“mixer not initialized”). Probably due to race condition — added a short try/except to handle it gracefully.

Week 2.1 – Playlist and Auto Refresh Testing (Group)
We tested playlist creation and selection together. Initially, playlist dropdown didn’t update until restart — realised we forgot to refresh the OptionMenu variable.
We rewrote it to rebuild the menu each time a new playlist is created. That fixed it.

Group testing also found that songs added to playlists were sometimes duplicated. I added a check before appending:

if song not in playlist:
    playlist.append(song)


That solved the duplication issue.

Week 3.1 – YouTube Downloader Integration
Started testing the YouTube audio download section. Using yt_dlp worked fine in isolation, but inside Tkinter it kept throwing a “no module named yt_dlp” error.
Installed it using pip install yt-dlp, re-ran, and confirmed it downloaded .webm files correctly.

Then I realised ffmpeg was needed for conversion. The error said:

ERROR: Postprocessing: ffprobe and ffmpeg not found

Spent like half an hour trying to fix it — finally downloaded ffmpeg manually, extracted it, and added the path to system environment variables. Restarted terminal and tested with ffmpeg -version to confirm it worked.

After that, downloads converted perfectly to .mp3 and auto-saved to the default folder.


Week 3.2 – GUI Column Layout (YouTube / Downloads / Playlist)
Reworked the GUI into 3 columns after feedback. I tested each section separately:

Left column: YouTube input + download button + folder selection

Middle column: Downloaded songs list

Right column: Playlist manager

Had some layout overlap issues because I used .pack() in all three — switched to .grid() and used consistent padding/margins. Fixed alignment.

During testing, download progress bar didn’t update smoothly — turns out I forgot to call root.update_idletasks() inside the thread. Added that and now the progress bar moves in real time. Looks great.

Week 3.3 – Final Functional Testing
Did a full end-to-end run:

Selected folder ✅

Downloaded YouTube audio ✅

Added song to playlist ✅

Played / paused / skipped songs ✅

Changed playlist ✅

Also tested edge cases:

Attempting to play with an empty playlist → now shows “No songs available” popup.

Downloading without selecting folder → added an error message so users know they need to choose one first.

Minor bug fixed: filenames with special characters (like “/” or “|”) broke downloads. Wrapped filename sanitization in:

re.sub(r'[\\/*?:"<>|]', "_", title)


Week 4.1 – Final Debugging & Cleanup
We ran through tests again as a group, trying to break things. Everything seemed stable.
Small UI polish: added scrollbar to song list, and disabled buttons when no song is loaded.

Also tested on another PC — initially crashed because ffmpeg wasn’t on PATH. Added a setup note in the README to remind users to install ffmpeg manually if missing.

All features confirmed working after final test:
✅ Folder selection
✅ YouTube audio downloads
✅ Progress bar
✅ Local playback (play/pause/next/prev)
✅ Playlist creation and switching
